# Image Detection
<br>
<br>
<h2> Face Detection </h2> <br>
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. 
OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc. <br> <br>
<b> Example Image-1 </b> <br> <br>
<img src= "Images/Screenshot%20(1446).png" height=300> <br> <br>
 <b> Example Image-2 </b> <br> <br>
<img src= "Images/Screenshot%20(1448).png" height=300>  <br> <br>  <br> <br>

<h2> Car Detection </h2> <br>
Car detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. 
OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for reading frames from a video file to run the deductions which generate the video with frames around the cars present on the road. <br> <br>
<b> Example Image-1 <br> <br>
<img src= "Images/Screenshot%20(1449).png" height=300> <br> <br>
<b> Example Image-2 <br> <br>
<img src= "Images/Screenshot%20(1450).png" height=300>
